INSTANT WITNESS</p>
<br>
<br>

<center>


<p>No twig did crunch – this man was extra weary<br>
As he approached a chrysanthemum glade<br>
Indistinct voices, smell of blooming cherry<br>
Mixed with a powder smell, and scent of cade. </p>
<p>A breath of wind brought cherry odour closer<br>
Small cordate petals streamed among the pines<br>
The cautious man took out his loyal Mauser<br>
The muzzle wounding air with trembling lines</p>
<p>They didn’t notice him. The first - deceasing<br>
In second’s arms, as flower fades and sears,<br>
The other listened to what he was wheezing,<br>
His face looked serene notwithstanding tears       </p>
<p>Once he did say he wouldn’t want to lose him<br>
There was no need or motive to repeat<br>
Young’s uniform was wet and dark at bosom<br>
A crimson rose was blooming out of it</p>
<p>The lone observer silently stepped backwards<br>
And dashed in headlong through the forest dark<br>
He ran avoiding trunks in sombre backwoods<br>
And through the burnt out plains with frameworks stark</p>
<p>No matter what he did and where was strolling<br>
Whom did he kill, that terrors had to face-<br>
He never fell asleep without recalling<br>
Two generals in their last embrace</p>

<p >KUNZITE’S LONGEST NIGHT</p>


<p>He rambles round in misty shade<br>
  He feels his soul a hand grenade<br>
  With roughly pulled-out iron pin<br>
  And tender petals hammered in</p>
<p>He stops to light a small cigar<br>
  And smokes while looking at the star<br>
  Eyelashes turn its blazing rays<br>
  Into a dewy silver maze</p>
<p>Uncertain lighting’s vague and dim<br>
  The twilight serves a mask for him<br>
  Concealing wet distorted face.<br>
  He climbs the tower staircase</p>
<p>Each landing seems to be his last<br>
  And fingers leave long weals in dust<br>
  Like coming down in stuffy vault<br>
  And taste of wind’s erased by salt </p>
<p>His castle sings a grief lament <br>
  The trees are sorrowfully bent<br>
  The towers freeze in silent moan<br>
  Since he returned back home alone</p>
